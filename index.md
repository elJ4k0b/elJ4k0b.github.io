# My website with a title
My favorite movie character is CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow. Ever since I watched the movie the first time, I loved his funny way of dealing with problems. Even though he might seem selfish in the first place, his character develops over the first two movies until he even sacrifices himself for his friends.
